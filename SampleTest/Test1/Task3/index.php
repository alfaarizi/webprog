<!-- 
Saving student records (3,5 points) Create a web page with a form through which we can add students and save them to a file. For each student, we need the following information and validation:

name: text input field, mandatory
age: number, mandatory
If there are errors, display the error messages in a list above the form. (1.5 points) If there is no error, save the data in a file! (2 points) You do not have to keep the form state! Note: when you create the file on the webprogramming server, don't forget to give it write access to everyone (F9 file properties, give "Other" W rights.) You can use the Storage utility to save it to a file!

<h1>New student</h1>
<form action="" method="post">
  Name: <input type="text" name="name" /> <br>
  Age: <input type="text" name="age" /> <br>
  <button type="submit">Add student</button>
</form>

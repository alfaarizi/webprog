# Goal today
- JavaScript basics
- Data representation (array, records)
- Programming patterns (control structures)

# Dynamic Web Pages
Dynamic server:
- The response content is generated by a program
- At the moment of request. the content does not exist on the server

Dynamic client:
- A program runs in the downloaded content
- This code changes the state of the browser window and the structure of the document

-> Programming
